# Queer Coded Fortune Teller: Introduction

Whenever there’s a talk about astrological signs and how they work, a response I always hear is, “So what, if I were born a minute later I would have been born under another sign?” and the answer is yes! I find it absolutely charming that the alignment of stars and planets at the moment of our birth makes up little traits that we can then use as excuses. We may be two-faced, but only because we’re Geminis, or we might be non-confrontational because our Mars sign is Virgo. It’s almost like the entire universe is cheering for us from the moment we’re born.

This is why I was always fascinated by the prospect of randomness and fortune telling. In Turkey, we tell fortunes from Turkish coffee cups, and I can’t help but wonder whether the sip I just took will result in a new romantic prospect or my downfall. Moreover, in cartomancy, it is said that one should take note of the cards that fall while shuffling the deck, as it also means that that card is linked to our future. Once again, all these little actions, whether it be a sip from a coffee cup or a card falling, feel like the universe is trying to cheer us on towards our “destiny”.

I’ve had the idea of creating a fortune teller project for years. I once saw a fortune-telling automaton in an arcade that sparked this idea. It was a female mannequin that had a crystal ball in front of her, and by placing a hand on the ball, one could have a fortune printed. I was completely transfixed by the automaton, and I even tried to call the number behind it to perhaps do an internship while I was doing my bachelor’s degree. (No one answered, by the way.) This then led me to do my research on the history of these fortune-telling automatons and discover what other kinds existed across different countries.

What pushed me to actually take action, however, was simply the fact that I wasn’t happy with the projects I was doing at work. I wanted to prove to myself that I was capable of doing the mechanical, electrical, and firmware design of a project, with the hope that I could be considered for a design and engineering job.

So I set out for this project with these three components in mind: software/firmware, mechanical, and electrical. I then decided to give myself little milestones to reach in these three areas. I had a vague idea of what I wanted to do, which was to print fortunes, have some kind of light show, and just be “complete”. I didn’t want jumper wires hanging off the sides, or something that could work well, but only sometimes; I wanted to have a PCB manufactured, proper cable management, and aesthetic value. In other words, I wanted to make something that could be plugged in and work like an appliance. With this goal in mind, I started making a list of requirements.

The device must:

1. print some kind of a fortune,
2. be electrically safe,
3. mechanically sound,
4. have some kind of crystal ball imagery in its design,
5. not need any complex inputs
6. be plug-and-play.

In the end, I decided to create a device that would print a three-card tarot spread with a thermal printer. I’m using my blog as a dev-log to keep track of my progress and document what I’ve accomplished.

As I’m finishing this post, I’ve already accomplished several of the milestones I’ve set out to do. It’s one of the most rewarding projects I’ve done so far, it’s so rewarding to see your vision come to life, not to reach a KPI or appeal to potential clients or employers.
