# ID403 Energy Saving Kit for a Beer Cooler

The ID403 Collaborative Design course is a course aimed at non-designers offered by the Industrial Design Department at Middle East Technical University. It takes place in the METU Design Factory and the aim of the course is to deliver a proof-of-concept design for a problem brought by industry partners. In this case, the industry partner was Anadolu Efes, the most popular beer brand in Turkey. The groups are formed to create an interdisciplinary working environment with a heavy emphasis on the concept of design thinking. Our group was named "Another Design"

The process starts by defining and redefining the problem brought by Anadolu Efes. Anadolu Efes wanted to reduce the beer coolers' energy consumption for their 90.000 beer coolers distributed all across Turkey. We started by interviewing the owners of these coolers to better understand their experience and how customers interact with them. The customers ranged from bar owners to local shops and they were all skeptical of the "eco mode" advertised by the cooler manufacturer. We proceeded to tour the factory of the beer coolers to see how they were manufactured, what were the design limitations, what were the focal points of energy loss and we interviewed the engineers.

Since there were 90.000 coolers distributed across the country and they were differing in age and models, it became apparent to us that instead of creating an alternative energy source like solar panels like Anadolu Efes was hinting towards, it would be more practical and applicable preventing the energy loss from the coolers in the form of cold air escaping.

After our field research, we began prototyping our solutions and testing them by measuring the energy consumption of the coolers with our "energy saving kit".

In the end, we came up an air curtain to prevent the escape of cold air. The air curtain would move depending on whether the customer was grabbing a bottle from the higher or lower shelves, essentially preventing the "spill" of cold air.

When we measured the energy consumption of the beer cooler modified with our energy saving kit, we saw that there was a decrease of about 25%. Extrapolated to 90.000 beer coolers across the country, this proof of concept design made our industry partner very happy.
